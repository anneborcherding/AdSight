# AdSight

AdSight pursues the goal to make the impact of billboard advertising more visible and approachable. To this end, it leverages location data provided by Cisco Space, and enhances it with DNS data and information on where the billboards are located. With this information, AdSight can analyze how many people werde looking at the advertisement (by using the location data) and how many of them interacted with the advertisement by visiting the advertiser's website afterwards (using the DNS data).

The dashboard can be accessed at [adsight.space](adsight.space) ðŸš€ Feel free to visit the webpage, try AdSight and give us feedback!
